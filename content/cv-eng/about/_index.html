			<p>
				I am a problem-solving person who performs and thrives in new environments.<br>
				A soon-to-be developer in dotNET. (Graduating May -23)</p>
				<p>
				I left Sweden over ten years ago as a trained car mechanic.<br>
				Since then I've had many years of work experience in various professions, in several countries.<br>
				The challenges that accompany this lifestyle have taught me to work productively when opportunities
				and circumstances constantly change.
				It made me flexible and stubborn.</p>

				I am passionate about an agile lifestyle and agile work.<br>
				My varied background makes me a creative problem solver,<br>
				with the ability to see things from different perspectives and strong social skills.
